cat REDESIGN_PROPOSAL | grep CATEGORY: | perl -lne 'if ($_ =~/^CATEGORY/) {$_=~s/^CATEGORY://; print q{  } .$_;}'
-------------------------------------------------------------------

CATEGORY: TESTS IMPROVEMENTS
----------------------------

REQUIREMENT:
tests should cover the whole of run lifecycle, including user interaction
SOLUTION:
use Selenium
consider using https://github.com/kablamo/Test-WWW-Selenium-More?
TASK: set up Selenium http://seleniumhq.org/projects/webdriver/
( urgency: urgent
  time estimate: ??
)

CATEGORY: REDESIGN OF MODELS
----------------------------

REQUIREMENT:
reduce maintenance overhead for npg models
SOLUTION:
have one type of models - DBIx;
DBIx models are auto-generated; capable of supporting relatively complex queries out of the box;
have good DBIx models
TASK: npg_tracking::Schema::Result existing models refactoring
      see also RT#188218: Shared methods in npg_tracking::Schema::Result::*
               RT#190956: dbix binding for npg tracking annotation table: graceful handling of dates
               RT##234632: npg_tracking::Schema code review
( time estimate: do as needed,
  urgency: urgent,
)
TASK: npg::model backend - replace Clearpress models by  DBIx models
( time estimate: ??,
  urgency: urgent,
  depends on: TASK(set-up Selenium)
)

REQUIREMENT:
model-level status rules
TASK: move instrument status graph to db
( time estimate: 3 days,
  urgency: moderate,
  depends on: TASK(npg::model backend - replace Clearpress models by  DBIx models)
)

CATEGORY: RUN AND INSTRUMENT TRACKING
-----------------------------------------

REQUIREMENT:
improve/amend instrument poller
TASK: RT#203939: Automatic instrument runfolder deletion
      see also RT#180080: trawl for and remove old folders from instrument disks
TASK: RT#211772: npg-tracking - improve instrument polling robustness
TASK: RT#212302: npg Monitor - cleanup (wishlist)
TASK: use winshare instead of ftp
      have both working for a while
TASK: prevent a deadlock when no runfolder name is stored on the db, the
      run is created yesterday, and started today;

REQUIREMENT:
need to know the actual length of each read (many reads these days)
TASK: #196314: npg tracking: back populate reads in NPG tracking with cycle count info
      also see RT#159038: Track reads for runs


REQUIREMENT: improve/amend staging monitor
TASK: RT#166131: CIF integrity check for mirror complete


REQUIREMENT: 
TASK: RT#191887: npg tracking - allow team117 to continue if NPG tracking is unavailable

REQUIREMENT:
independent tracking of flowcell on HiSeq instruments
TASK: created a suitable model and implement in DBIX
( depends on: TASK(npg::model backend - replace Clearpress models by  DBIx models)
)

CATEGORY: PIPELINE INTERACTION
------------------------------   

REQUIREMENT:
the staging monitor, instrument poller and the analysis pipeline to support default
Illumina runfolder names to enable tracking of a variety of instruments and processing
third party runfolders
SOLUTION:
id_run should be optional in the runfolder name
TASK: remove id_run validation in short info and similar modules


REQUIREMENT:
decouple the analysis pipeline from the tracking web server and the reference repository
to allow for a stand-alone lane-based pipeline
TASK: two modes for reference finder - live and from cached info through this interface
               RT#241842: reference finder redesign
( time estimate: 1 weeks
  urgency: medium
  depends on: TASK(create abstract lims interface)
)
RELATED TASK: analysis and autoqc should be able to use arbitrary ids instead if id_run? - not sure

TASK: run status on last lane past this status
( time estimate: 1 week
  urgency: medium
  depends on: TASK(extend staging monitor to pick up run and lane statuses)
)
TASK: tracking web app - display lane statuses
( time estimate: ?
  urgency: low
  depends on: TASK(run status on last lane past this status)
)

CATEGORY: WEB APP, GUI
-------------------------------

REQUIREMENT: 
correct role-based permissions in the tracking web apps (admin should not be able to do all)
TASK: find out whether magical powers of admin are hardcoded in clearpress
      if yes - can this be remedied?
      map existing web forms to user roles, consult teamsA-C,R&D if needed
      revise the code (models, views, templates)
      decide the level on which permissions will be enforced (views only?)
      change the code
      create Selenium tests 
( time estimate: 2 weeks?
  urgency: medium
  depends on: TASK(set-up Selenium)
)

TASK: fix paging of run info in instrument pages
see RT#281583

REQUIREMENT: have all the run info on the run page , in case something goes wrong with the data quality, G/C bias
TASK: RT#174655: Record and report kit, instrument software, analysis sofware versions
( time estimate: ?
  urgency: low
)

REQUIREMENT: improve search, both GUI and algorithm
TASK: redesign search?
also see RT#200976: couple of NPG bugs
   
REQUIREMENT:
reduce code repetition between application
TASK: npg run and lane annotations views (read-write) that can be shared between npg and Qsea RT#160090
( time estimate: ?
  urgency: low
  depends on: TASK(npg::model backend - replace Clearpress models by  DBIx models)
)

REQUIREMENT:
more information
TASK: RT#207721: npg-tracking : link to the iRods page for archived run
TASK: RT#225087: Add release flag information to NPG web pages

REQUIREMENT:
independent tracking of flowcell on HiSeq instruments
TASK: created suitable visual representation and widgets
(depends on: TASK(created a suitable model and implement in DBIX)
)

CATEGORY: REPORTS
-----------------

REQUIREMENT:
ensure emails (content&recipients) are up-to-date
TASK: RT#184260: NPG-tracking - Review emails sent to "engineers"

REQUIREMENT:
ensure maintanability and correcteness of instrument utilisation and up&down reports
TASK: refactor/reimplement instrument reports and supply with a good test suit
( time estimate: ?
  urgency: moderate
  depends on: TASK(npg::model backend - replace Clearpress models by  DBIx models)
)
TASK: move reports out of the interactive application
( time estimate: ?
  urgency: low
  depends on: TASK(refactor/reimplement instrument reports)
)
